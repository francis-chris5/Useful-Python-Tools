# Useful-Python-Tools
A collection of tools I have created for working in python.


<b>ClassGenerator</b>

<blockqoute>
  A python scripts which generates a basic start to a class structure in python: __init__ and getters and setters for a list of attributes passed in. Though most uses of it will need adjustment afterward, such as assigning default values if not passed in with the list of attributes and custom methods.
  
  Also included test_create_class.py to demonstrate usage.
